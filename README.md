# my_api


Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

For this project, I had to use at least 1 of the supplied APIs to grab data from at least 6 items from that API. For example, 6 books on Open Library, or 6 movies from the Open Movie Database. Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles. Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox with detailed information about the item.

Note: IMDB blocks the download of the posters from OMDB on a live server, so download files to view the movie portion of this project.
